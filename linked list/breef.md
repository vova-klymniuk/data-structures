## Linked list:
```
    A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at
    continuos memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using
    pointers as shown in the below image:

    Types of linked lists:
        - Single-linked list 
        - Doubly linked list
        - Circular linked list
        - Doubly circular linked list

         Head
         /

       v

    |  A    |    | ---> |  A    |    | --->  |  C    |    | ---> |  D     |   |   ---->   NULL

Characteristics of a Linked list:

```
A linked list has various characteristics which are as follows:
    - A linked list uses extra memory to store links.
    - During the initialization of the linked list, 
        there is no need to know the size of the elements.
    - Linked lists are used to implement: 
         `stacks`, `queues`, `graphs`, etc.
    - The first node of the linked list is called the Head.
    - The next pointer of the last node always points to NULL.
    - In a linked list, insertion and deletion are possible easily.
    - Each node of the linked list consists of a pointer/link which is the adddress of the next node.
    - Linked lists can shrink or grow at any point in time easily.

Applications of the Linked list:
Different applications of linked lists are as follows:
    - Linked lists are used to implement:
        `stacks`, `queues`, `graphs`, etc.
    - Linked lists are used to perform arithmetic operations on long integers.
    - It is used for the representation of sparse matricies.
    - It helps in memory management.
    - It is used in the representation of Polynomial Maniupultaion where each
      polynomial term represents a node in the linked list.
    - Linked lists are used to display image containers.
      Users can visit past, current, and next images.
    - They are used to store the history of the visited page.
    - They are used to perform undo operations.
    - Linked are used in software development where they indicate the correct syntax of a tag.
    - Linked lists are used to display social media feeds.
